  <h1>Welcome to Treasure Islands</h1>
    <p>Your treasure is our pleasure! Dont be like the rest and rent some stinky accomodation with bad karmic vibes.
    Spend some real money with us and rent out an entire island to yourself with zero nosy neighbours.
    As a great man once said, "Do what thou Wilt!".
    I mean come on, If you have the money why shouldnt you be able to do what you want right?
    Sacrificial cats not supplied...</p>
